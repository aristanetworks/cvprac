## Overview

This module provides a RESTful API client for Cloudvision® Portal (CVP)
which can be used for building applications that work with Arista CVP.

When the class is instantiated the logging is configured. Either syslog,
file logging, both, or none can be enabled. If neither syslog nor
filename is specified then no logging will be performed.

This class supports creating a connection to a CVP node and then issuing
subsequent GET and POST requests to CVP. A GET or POST request will be
automatically retried on the same node if the request receives a
requests.exceptions.Timeout or ReadTimeout error. A GET or POST request
will be automatically retried on the same node if the request receives a
CvpSessionLogOutError. For this case a login will be performed before
the request is retried. For either case, the maximum number of times a
request will be retried on the same node is specified by the class
attribute NUM\_RETRY\_REQUESTS.

If more than one CVP node is specified when creating a connection, and a
GET or POST request that receives a requests.exceptions.ConnectionError,
requests.exceptions.HTTPError, or a requests.exceptions.TooManyRedirects
will be retried on the next CVP node in the list. If a GET or POST
request that receives a requests.exceptions.Timeout or
CvpSessionLogOutError and the retries on the same node exceed
NUM\_RETRY\_REQUESTS, then the request will be retried on the next node
on the list.

If any of the errors persists across all nodes then the GET or POST
request will fail and the last error that occurred will be raised.

The class provides connect, get, and post methods that allow the user to
make RESTful API calls to CVP. See the example below using the get
method.

The class provides a wrapper function around the CVP RESTful API
operations. Each API method takes the RESTful API parameters as method
parameters to the operation method. The API class was added to the
client class because the API functions are required when using the CVP
RESTful API and placing them in this library avoids duplicating the
calls in every application that uses this class. See the examples below
using the API methods.

### Requirements

- Python 2.7 or later
- Python logging module
- Python requests module version 1.0.0 or later

## Installation

The source code for cvprac is provided on Github at
<https://github.com/aristanetworks/cvprac>. All current development is
done in the develop branch. Stable released versions are tagged in the
master branch and uploaded to <https://pypi.python.org>.

If your platform has internet access you can use the Python Package
manager to install cvprac.

    admin:~ admin$ sudo pip install cvprac

You can upgrade cvprac

    admin:~ admin$ sudo pip install --upgrade cvprac

### Development: Run from Source

We recommend running cvprac in a virtual environment. For more
information, read this:
<http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/>

These instructions will help you install and run cvprac from source.
This is useful if you plan on contributing or if you would always like
to see the latest code in the develop branch. Note that these steps
require the pip and git commands.

#### Step 1: Clone the cvprac Github repo

    # Go to a directory where you'd like to keep the source
    admin:~ admin$ cd ~/projects
    admin:~ admin$ git clone https://github.com/aristanetworks/cvprac
    admin:~ admin$ cd cvprac

#### Step 2: Check out the desired version or branch

    # Go to a directory where you'd like to keep the source
    admin:~ admin$ cd ~/projects/cvprac

    # To see a list of available versions or branches
    admin:~ admin$ git tag
    admin:~ admin$ git branch

    # Checkout the desired version of code
    admin:~ admin$ git checkout v1.0.3

#### Step 3: Install cvprac using Pip with -e switch

    # Go to a directory where you'd like to keep the source
    admin:~ admin$ cd ~/projects/cvprac

    # Install
    admin:~ admin$ sudo pip install -e ~/projects/cvprac

#### Step 4: Install cvprac development requirements

    # Go to a directory where you'd like to keep the source
    admin:~ admin$ pip install -r dev-requirements.txt

## Getting Started

Once the package has been installed you can run the following example to
verify that everything has been installed properly.

### Connecting

Connecting to CVP will depend on your CVP setup. Several options are
outlined below.

### CVP On Premises

CVP On Premises is for users with CVP running on a local server or
cluster of servers. This is the standard form of connection. Multiple
examples below demonstrate connecting to CVP On Premises setups.

### CVaaS

CVaaS is CloudVision as a Service. Users with CVaaS must use a REST API
token for accessing CVP with REST APIs.

- In the case where users authenticate with CVP (CVaaS) using Oauth a
- REST API token is required to be generated and used for running REST
- APIs. In this case no username/password login is necessary, but the
- API token (via api\_token parameter) must be provided to cvprac client
- with the is\_cvaas parameter. In the case that the api\_token is used
- for REST APIs the username and password will be ignored and the tenant
- parameter is not needed.

An example of a CVaaS connection is shown below.

Note that the token parameter was previously cvaas\_token but this has
been converted to api\_token because tokens are also available for usage
with On Prem CVP deployments. The api\_token parameter name is more
generic in this sense. If you are using the cvaas\_token parameter
please convert to api\_token because the cvaas\_token parameter will be
deprecated in the future.

### CVP Version Handling

The CVP RESTful APIs often change between releases of CVP. Cvprac
attempts to mask these API changes from the user via making appropriate
API calls based on the CVP version while attempting to maintain return
data and not changing function names when possible. This helps maintain
backward compatibility for users when they upgrade CVP so that any
custom automation/scripts will continue to work. In some cases
maintaining return data requires additional API calls so there are cases
where this comes with the cost of a slight performance hit. Users are
free to access the clients get(), post() and delete() methods and make
API calls directly if they want to avoid the potential time delay of
some API functions. The current API version information handled by
cvprac is shown below.

- Current latest API version is 4.0 API version is set to latest
- available version for CVaaS API version is set to 4.0 for 2020.1.1 and
- beyond. API version is set to 3.0 for 2019.0.0 through 2020.1.0 API
- version is set to 2.0 for 2018.2.X API version is set to 1.0 for
- 2018.1.X and prior

### Examples

Example using CVP On Prem client get method directly:

    >>> from cvprac.cvp_client import CvpClient
    >>> clnt = CvpClient()
    >>> clnt.connect(['cvp1', 'cvp2', 'cvp3'], 'cvp_user', 'cvp_word')
    >>> result = clnt.get('/cvpInfo/getCvpInfo.do')
    >>> print result
    {u'version': u'2016.1.0'}
    >>>

Same example as above using the API method:

    >>> from cvprac.cvp_client import CvpClient
    >>> clnt = CvpClient()
    >>> clnt.connect(['cvp1', 'cvp2', 'cvp3'], 'cvp_user', 'cvp_word')
    >>> result = clnt.api.get_cvp_info()
    >>> print result
    {u'version': u'2016.1.0'}
    >>>

Same example as above but connecting to CVaaS with a token: Note that
the username and password parameters are required by the connect
function but will be ignored when using api\_token:

    >>> from cvprac.cvp_client import CvpClient
    >>> clnt = CvpClient()
    >>> clnt.connect(nodes=['cvaas'], username='', password='', is_cvaas=True, api_token='user token')
    >>> result = clnt.api.get_cvp_info()
    >>> print result
    {u'version': u'cvaas'}
    >>>

Example using the API method to create a container, wait 5 seconds, then
delete the container. Before running this example manually create a
container named DC-1 on your CVP node.

    >>> import time
    >>> from cvprac.cvp_client import CvpClient
    >>> clnt = CvpClient()
    >>> clnt.connect(['cvp1'], 'cvp_user', 'cvp_word')
    >>> parent = clnt.api.search_topology('DC-1')
    >>> clnt.api.add_container('TORs', 'DC-1', parent['containerList'][0]['key'])
    >>> child = clnt.api.search_topology('TORs')
    >>> time.sleep(5)
    >>> result = clnt.api.delete_container('TORs', child['containerList'][0]['key'], 'DC-1', parent['containerList'][0]['key'])
    >>>

## Notes for API Class Usage

### Containers

With the API the containers are added for all cases. If you add the
container to the original root container 'Tenant' then you have to do a
refresh from the GUI to see the container after it is added or deleted.
If the root container has been renamed or the parent container is not
the root container then an add or delete will update the GUI without
requiring a manual refresh.

## Testing

The cvprac module provides system tests. To run the system tests, you
will need to update the `cvp_nodes.yaml` file found in test/fixtures.

Requirements for running the system tests:

- Need one CVP node for test with a test user account. Create the same
  account on the switch used for testing. The user account information
  follows:

        username: CvpRacTest
        password: AristaInnovates

        If switch does not have correct username and/or password then the tests that
        execute tasks will fail with the following error:

        AssertionError: Execution for task id 220 failed and in the test log is the error:

        Failure response received from the netElement : ' Unauthorized User '

- Test has dedicated access to the CVP node.
- CVP node contains at least one device in a container.
- Container or device has at least one configlet applied.

To run the system tests:

- run `make tests` from the root of the cvprac source folder.

### Working With Git

It is recommended to fork the project and then start development on the forked repository's **develop** branch. This can achieved with the below steps:

- [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) the repo then clone your fork,
   and configure the remotes:

        # Clone your fork of the repo into the current directory
        git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/cvprac

        # Navigate to the newly cloned directory
        cd cvprac

        # Assign the original repo to a remote called "upstream"
        git remote add upstream https://github.com/aristanetworks/cvprac.git

- If you cloned a while ago, get the latest changes from upstream:

        # Work on the develop branch of the forked repo
        git checkout develop

        # Pull the latest changes from the develop branch of aristanetworks cvprac
        git pull upstream develop

- Create a new topic branch (off the main project development branch) to
   contain your feature, change, or fix:

       git checkout -b <topic-branch-name>

- Commit your changes in logical chunks. Please adhere to these [git commit
   message guidelines](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html)
   or your code is unlikely to be merged into the main project. Use Git's
   [git rebase](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/about-git-rebase)
   feature to tidy up your commits before making them public.

- Locally merge (or rebase) the upstream development branch into your topic branch every time before pushing it to your fork:

        # Here the <dev-branch> is develop
        git pull [--rebase] upstream <dev-branch>

- Push your topic branch up to your fork:

        git push origin <topic-branch-name>

- [Open a Pull Request](https://github.com/aristanetworks/cvprac/pulls)
    with a clear title, description and explain how to test the feature.

### Submitting Pull Requests

- It is recommended to open an issue before starting work on a pull request to make sure if the same issue is not reported previously and someone is already working on that. When suggesting a new feature, also make sure it won't conflict with any work that's already in progress.

- Once the issue is opened either self-assign the issue or ask the maintainer to assign it for you. This will make sure no others are working on the same issue.

- All new functionality must include relevant tests where applicable.

- When submitting a pull request, please be sure to work off of the **develop** branch and not from other branches. The **develop** branch is used for ongoing development, while the **master** will hold the last stable version.

- To automate release-notes creation and make filtering process easier, it is strongly recommended to use [conventional commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary) syntax at least for Pull Request (PR) title.

- All code submissions must follow the below criteria:

  - The issue/PR title should follow the semantic as described [here](#pull-request-semantics)
  - All the tests are updated and are passed successfully
  - Python syntax is valid

### Pull Request Semantics

The Pull Request title should start with one of the below to easily segregate if its a feature add or a bug or something related documentation etc.

It is strongly recommended to use one from the below:

- ```Feat```: Create a capability e.g. feature, test, dependency
- ```Fix```: Fix an issue e.g. bug, typo, accident, misstatement
- ```Doc```: Refactor of documentation, e.g. help files
- ```Test```: Add or refactor anything regarding test, e.g add a new testCases or missing testCases
- ```Refactor```: A code change that MUST be just a refactoring
- ```Bump```: Increase the version of something e.g. dependency
- ```Revert```: Change back to the previous commit
- ```Optimize```: Refactor of performance, e.g. speed up code
- ```CI```: Update CI components, e.g. molecule files or Github Actions
- ```Cut```: Remove a capability e.g. feature, test, dependency

For example:

- Feat: Add support for decommissioning APIs
- Test: Add missing test cases for change control
- Doc: Document new examples for change control
